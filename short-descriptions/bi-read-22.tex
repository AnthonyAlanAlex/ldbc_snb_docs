\paragraph{Q22.}
Consider all pairs of people \texttt{(p1,\ p2)} such that one is located
in a city of Country \texttt{countryX} and the other is located in a
city of Country \texttt{countryY}.
For each city of Country \texttt{countryX}, return the highest scoring
pair.
The score of a pair is defined as the sum of the scores of the following
kinds of interaction:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{p1} has created a reply Comment to at least one Comment or
  Post by \texttt{p2}: \texttt{Score\ =\ 4}
\item
  \texttt{p1} has created at least one Post or Comment that \texttt{p2}
  has created a reply Comment to: \texttt{Score\ =\ 1}
\item
  \texttt{p1} and \texttt{p2} Know each other: \texttt{Score\ =\ 15}
\item
  \texttt{p1} liked at least one Post or Comment by \texttt{p2}:
  \texttt{Score\ =\ 10}
\item
  \texttt{p1} has created at least one Post or Comment that was liked by
  \texttt{p2}: \texttt{Score\ =\ 1}
\end{itemize}
Consequently, the maximum score a pair can obtain is:
\texttt{4\ +\ 1\ +\ 15\ +\ 10\ +\ 1\ =\ 31}
