\paragraph{Q22.}
Consider all pairs of people \texttt{(p1,\ p2)} such that one is located
in a \emph{City} of \emph{Country} \texttt{country1} and the other is
located in a city of \emph{Country} \texttt{country2}.
For each city of \emph{Country} \texttt{country1}, return the highest
scoring pair.
The score of a pair is defined as the sum of the scores of the following
kinds of interaction:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{p1} has created a reply \emph{Comment} to at least one
  \emph{Comment} or \emph{Post} by \texttt{p2}: \texttt{Score\ =\ 4}
\item
  \texttt{p1} has created at least one \emph{Post} or \emph{Comment}
  that \texttt{p2} has created a reply \emph{Comment} to:
  \texttt{Score\ =\ 1}
\item
  \texttt{p1} and \texttt{p2} \emph{know} each other:
  \texttt{Score\ =\ 15}
\item
  \texttt{p1} liked at least one \emph{Post} or \emph{Comment} by
  \texttt{p2}: \texttt{Score\ =\ 10}
\item
  \texttt{p1} has created at least one \emph{Post} or \emph{Comment}
  that was liked by \texttt{p2}: \texttt{Score\ =\ 1}
\end{itemize}
Consequently, the maximum score a pair can obtain is:
\texttt{4\ +\ 1\ +\ 15\ +\ 10\ +\ 1\ =\ 31}
