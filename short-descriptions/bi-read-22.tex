\paragraph{\textbf{Q22}. International dialog.}
Consider all pairs of people \texttt{(person1,\ person2)} such that one
is located in a \emph{City} of \emph{Country} \texttt{country1} and the
other is located in a \emph{City} of \emph{Country} \texttt{country2}.
For each \emph{City} of \emph{Country} \texttt{country1}, return the
highest scoring pair. The score of a pair is defined as the sum of the
subscores awarded for the following kinds of interaction. The initial
value is \texttt{score\ =\ 0}.
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{person1} has created a reply \emph{Comment} to at least one
  \emph{Message} by \texttt{person2}: \texttt{score\ +=\ 4}
\item
  \texttt{person1} has created at least one \emph{Message} that
  \texttt{person2} has created a reply \emph{Comment} to:
  \texttt{score\ +=\ 1}
\item
  \texttt{person1} and \texttt{person2} \emph{know} each other:
  \texttt{score\ +=\ 15}
\item
  \texttt{person1} liked at least one \emph{Message} by
  \texttt{person2}: \texttt{score\ +=\ 10}
\item
  \texttt{person1} has created at least one \emph{Message} that was
  liked by \texttt{person2}: \texttt{score\ +=\ 1}
\end{enumerate}
Consequently, the maximum score a pair can obtain is:
\texttt{4\ +\ 1\ +\ 15\ +\ 10\ +\ 1\ =\ 31}.
To break ties, order by (1) \texttt{person1.id} {[}ascending{]} and (2)
\texttt{person2.id} {[}ascending{]}.
