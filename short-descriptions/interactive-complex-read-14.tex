\paragraph{\textbf{Q14}. Trusted connection paths.}
Given two Persons, find all (unweighted) shortest paths between these
two Persons, in the subgraph induced by the Knows relationship.
Then, for each path calculate a weight. The nodes in the path are
Persons, and the weight of a path is the sum of weights between every
pair of consecutive Person nodes in the path.
The weight for a pair of Persons is calculated based on their
interactions:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Every direct reply (by one of the Persons) to a Post (by the other
  Person) contributes 1.0.
\item
  Every direct reply (by ones of the Persons) to a Comment (by the other
  Person) contributes 0.5.
\end{itemize}
Return all the paths with shortest length, and their weights. Do not
return any rows if there is no path between the two Persons.
