\paragraph{\textbf{Q14}. Weighted/unweighted paths.}
Given two Persons, find all (unweighted) shortest paths between these
two Persons, in the subgraph induced by the Knows relationship. Then,
for each path calculate a weight. The nodes in the path are Persons, and
the weight of a path is the sum of weights between every pair of
consecutive Person nodes in the path. The weight for a pair of Persons
is calculated such that every reply (by one of the Persons) to a Post
(by the other Person) contributes 1.0, and every reply (by ones of the
Persons) to a Comment (by the other Person) contributes 0.5. Return all
the paths with shortest length, and their weights. Do not return any
rows if there is no path between the two Persons.
