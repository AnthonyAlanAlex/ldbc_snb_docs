\paragraph{\textbf{Q7}. Recent likers.}
Given a start \emph{Person}, find (most recent) \texttt{likes} on any of
start \emph{Person}'s \emph{Messages}. Find \emph{Persons} that liked
(\texttt{likes} edge) any of start \emph{Person}'s \emph{Messages}, the
\emph{Messages} they liked most recently, the creation date of that
like, and the latency in minutes (\texttt{minutesLatency}) between
creation of \emph{Messages} and like. Additionally, for each
\emph{Person} found return a flag indicating (\texttt{isNew}) whether
the liker is a friend of start \emph{Person}. In case that a
\emph{Person} liked multiple \emph{Messages} at the same time, return
