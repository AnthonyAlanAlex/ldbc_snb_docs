\paragraph{Q25.}
Given two \emph{Persons}, find all (unweighted) shortest paths between
these two \emph{Persons}, in the subgraph induced by the \emph{knows}
relationship.
Then, for each path calculate a weight. The nodes in the path are
\emph{Persons}, and the weight of a path is the sum of weights between
every pair of consecutive \emph{Person} nodes in the path.
The weight for a pair of \emph{Persons} is calculated such that every
reply (by one of the \emph{Persons}) to a \emph{Post} (by the other
\emph{Person}) contributes 1.0, and every reply (by ones of the
\emph{Persons}) to a \emph{Comment} (by the other \emph{Person})
contributes 0.5.
Only consider \emph{Messages} that were created in a \emph{Forum} that
was created within the timeframe \texttt{{[}startDate,\ endDate{]}}.
Return all the paths with shortest length, and their weights.
