Given two Persons, person1 and person2, find all (unweighted) shortest
paths between these two Persons, in the subgraph induced by the Knows

relationship.
Then, for each path calculate a weight. The nodes in the path are
\emph{Persons}, and the weight of a path is the sum of weights between
every pair of consecutive \emph{Person} nodes in the path.
The weight for a pair of \emph{Persons} is calculated such that
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  every reply (by one of the \emph{Persons}) to a \emph{Post} (by the
  other \emph{Person}) contributes 1.0, and
\item
  every reply (by one of the \emph{Persons}) to a \emph{Comment} (by the
  other \emph{Person}) contributes 0.5.
\end{itemize}
Only consider \emph{Messages} that were created in a \emph{Forum} that
was created within the timeframe \texttt{{[}startDate,\ endDate{]}}.
Return all the paths with shortest length, and their weights.
