\paragraph{\textbf{Q25}. Trusted connection paths.}
Given two \emph{Persons}, find all (unweighted) shortest paths between
these two \emph{Persons}, in the subgraph induced by the \emph{knows}
relationship.
Then, for each path calculate a weight. The nodes in the path are
\emph{Persons}, and the weight of a path is the sum of weights between
every pair of consecutive \emph{Person} nodes in the path.
The weight for a pair of \emph{Persons} is calculated based on their
interactions:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Every direct reply (by one of the \emph{Persons}) to a \emph{Post} (by
  the other \emph{Person}) contributes 1.0.
\item
  Every direct reply (by one of the \emph{Persons}) to a \emph{Comment}
  (by the other \emph{Person}) contributes 0.5.
\end{itemize}
Only consider \emph{Messages} that were created in a \emph{Forum} that
was created within the timeframe \texttt{{[}startDate,\ endDate{]}}.
Note that for \emph{Comments}, the containing \emph{Forum} is that of
the \emph{Post} that the comment (transitively) replies to.
Return all paths with the \emph{Person} ids ordered by their weights
descending.
