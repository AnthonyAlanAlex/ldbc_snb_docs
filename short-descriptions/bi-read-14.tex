\paragraph{\textbf{Q14}. Top thread initiators.}
For each \emph{Person}, count the number of \emph{Posts} they created in
the time interval \texttt{{[}startDate,\ endDate{]}} (equivalent to the
number of threads they initiated) and the number of \emph{Messages} in
each of their (transitive) reply trees, including the root \emph{Post}
of each tree. When calculating \emph{Message} counts only consider
messages created within the given time interval.
Return each \emph{Person}, number of \emph{Posts} they created, and the
count of all \emph{Messages} that appeared in the reply trees (including
the \emph{Post} at the root of tree) they created.
