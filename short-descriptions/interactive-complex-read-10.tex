\paragraph{\textbf{Q10}. Friend recommendation.}
Given a start \emph{Person} (\texttt{rootPerson}), find that
\emph{Person}'s friends of friends (\texttt{person}) - excluding
\texttt{rootPerson}, and immediate friends -, who were born on or after
the 21st of a given month (in any year) and before the 22nd of the
following month. Calculate the similarity between each \texttt{person}
and \texttt{rootPerson}, where \texttt{commonInterestScore} is defined
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{common} = number of \emph{Posts} created by \texttt{person},
  such that the \emph{Post} has a \emph{Tag} that \texttt{rootPerson} is
  interested in
\item
  \texttt{uncommon} = number of \emph{Posts} created by \texttt{person},
  such that the \emph{Post} has no \emph{Tag} that \texttt{rootPerson}
  is interested in
\item
  \texttt{commonInterestScore} = \texttt{common} - \texttt{uncommon}
\end{itemize}
