\paragraph{\textbf{Q10}. Friend recommendation.}
Given a start \emph{Person} with id \texttt{personId}, find that
\emph{Person}'s friends of friends (\texttt{person}) -- excluding the
start \emph{Person} and his/her immediate friends --, who were born on
or after the 21st of a given \texttt{month} (in any year) and before the
22nd of the following month. Calculate the similarity between each
\texttt{person} and the start \emph{Person}, where
\texttt{commonInterestScore} is defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{common} = number of \emph{Posts} created by \texttt{person},
  such that the \emph{Post} has a \emph{Tag} that the start
  \emph{Person}, is interested in
\item
  \texttt{uncommon} = number of \emph{Posts} created by \texttt{person},
  such that the \emph{Post} has no \emph{Tag} that the start
  \emph{Person}, is interested in
\item
  \texttt{commonInterestScore} = \texttt{common} - \texttt{uncommon}
\end{itemize}
