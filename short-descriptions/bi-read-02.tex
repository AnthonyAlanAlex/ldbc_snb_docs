\paragraph{\textbf{Q2}. Top tags for country, age, gender, time.}
Select all \emph{Messages} created in the range of
\texttt{{[}startDate,\ endDate{]}} by \emph{Persons} located in
\texttt{country1} or \texttt{country2}. Select the creator
\emph{Persons} and the \emph{Tags} of these \emph{Messages}. Split these
\emph{Persons}, \emph{Tags} and \emph{Messages} into a 5-level grouping:
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  name of country of \emph{Person},
\item
  month the \emph{Message} was created,
\item
  gender of \emph{Person},
\item
  age group of \emph{Person}, defined as years between person's birthday
  and end of simulation (2013-01-01), divided by 5, rounded down
  (partial years do not count),
\item
  name of tag attached to \emph{Message}.
\end{enumerate}
Consider only those groups where number of \emph{Messages} is greater
than 100.
