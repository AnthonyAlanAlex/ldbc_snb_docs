\paragraph{\textbf{Q19}. Stranger's interaction.}
For all the \emph{Persons} (\texttt{person}) born after a certain
\texttt{date}, find all the \texttt{stranger}s they interacted with,
where \texttt{stranger}s are \emph{Persons} that do not \emph{know}
\texttt{person}. There is no restriction on the date that
\texttt{stranger}s were born.
Consider only \texttt{stranger}s that are
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  members of \emph{Forums} tagged with a \emph{Tag} with a (direct) type
  of \texttt{tagClass1} and
\item
  members of \emph{Forums} tagged with a \emph{Tag} with a (direct) type
  of \texttt{tagClass2}.
\end{itemize}
The \emph{Tags} may be attached to the same \emph{Forum} or they may be
attached to different \emph{Forums}.
Interaction is defined as follows: the \texttt{person} has replied to a
\emph{Message} by the \texttt{stranger} \emph{B} (the reply might be a
transitive one).
For each \texttt{person}, count the number of \texttt{strangers} they
interacted with (\texttt{strangerCount}) and total number of times they
interacted with them (\texttt{interactionCount}).
