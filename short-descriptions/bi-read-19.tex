\paragraph{Q19.}
For all the \emph{Persons} born after a certain \texttt{date}, find all
the strangers they interacted with, where strangers are \emph{Persons}
that do not \emph{know} each other. There is no restriction on the date
that strangers were born.
Consider only strangers that are members of \emph{Forums} tagged with
\texttt{tagClass1} (direct children not transitive) AND members of
\emph{Forums} tagged with \texttt{tagClass2} (direct children not
transitive). It does not matter if these \emph{Tags} are attached to the
same \emph{Forum}, or different \emph{Forums}.
Interaction is defined as follows: if \emph{Person} \emph{A} replies to
a \emph{Message} (\emph{Post} or \emph{Comment}) by another
\emph{Person} \emph{B}, there is an ``interacted with'' relationship
from \emph{A} to \emph{B}. Note that the ``interacted with''
relationship is directed.
For each \emph{Person}, count the number of strangers they interacted
with and total number of times they interacted with them.
