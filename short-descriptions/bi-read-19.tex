\paragraph{Q19.}
For all the \emph{Persons} born after a certain \texttt{date}, find all
the strangers they interacted with, where strangers are \emph{Persons}
that do not \emph{know} each other. There is no restriction on the date
that strangers were born.
Consider only strangers that are
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  members of \emph{Forums} tagged with a \emph{Tag} with a (direct) type
  of \texttt{tagClass1} and
\item
  members of \emph{Forums} tagged with a \emph{Tag} with a (direct) type
  of \texttt{tagClass2}.
\end{itemize}
The tags may be attached to the same \emph{Forum} or they may be
attached to different \emph{Forums}.
Interaction is defined as follows: if \emph{Person} \emph{A} replies to
a \emph{Message} by another \emph{Person} \emph{B}, there is an
``interacted with'' relationship from \emph{A} to \emph{B}. Note that
the ``interacted with'' relationship is directed.
For each \emph{Person}, count the number of strangers they interacted
with and total number of times they interacted with them.
