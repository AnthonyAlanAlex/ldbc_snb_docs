\paragraph{Q1.}

Given a date, find all Messages created before that date. Group them by
a 3-level grouping:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  by year of creation
\item
  for each year, group into message types (Posts or Comments)
\item
  for each year-type group, split into four groups based on length of
  their content

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    0 \textless{}= length \textless{} 40: \texttt{short}
  \item
    40 \textless{}= length \textless{} 80: \texttt{one\ liner}
  \item
    80 \textless{}= length \textless{} 160: \texttt{tweet}
  \item
    160 \textless{}= length: \texttt{long}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
