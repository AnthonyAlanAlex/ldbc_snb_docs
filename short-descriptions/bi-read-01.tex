\paragraph{Q1.}
Given a date, find all \emph{Messages} created before that date. Group
them by a 3-level grouping:
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  by year of creation
\item
  for each year, group into \emph{Message} types: is \emph{Comment} or
  not
\item
  for each year-type group, split into four groups based on length of
  their content
  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{0}: 0 \textless{}= length \textless{} 40~(short)
  \item
    \texttt{1}: 40 \textless{}= length \textless{} 80~(one liner)
  \item
    \texttt{2}: 80 \textless{}= length \textless{} 160~(tweet)
  \item
    \texttt{3}: 160 \textless{}= length~(long)
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
