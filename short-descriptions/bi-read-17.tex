\paragraph{\textbf{Q17}. Friend triangles.}
For a given \texttt{country}, count all the distinct triples of
\emph{Persons} such that:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{a} is friend of \texttt{b},
\item
  \texttt{b} is friend of \texttt{c},
\item
  \texttt{c} is friend of \texttt{a}.
\end{itemize}
Distinct means that given a triple \(t_1\) in the result set \(R\) of
all qualified triples, there is no triple \(t_2\) in \(R\) such that
\(t_1\) and \(t_2\) have the same set of elements.
