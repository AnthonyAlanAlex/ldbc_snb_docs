\paragraph{Q17.}
For a given country, count all the distinct triples of persons such that
\texttt{a} is friend of \texttt{b}, \texttt{b} is friend of \texttt{c},
and \texttt{c} is friend of \texttt{a}.
Distinct means that given a triple \(t_1\) in the result set \(R\) of
all qualified triples, there is not a triple \(t_2\) in \(R\) such that
\(t_1\) and \(t_2\) have the same set of elements.
