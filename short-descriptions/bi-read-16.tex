\paragraph{\textbf{Q16}. Experts in social circle.}
Given a \emph{Person}, find all other \emph{Persons} that live in a
given \texttt{country} and are connected to given \emph{Person} by a
transitive trail with length in range
\texttt{{[}minPathDistance,\ maxPathDistance{]}} through the
\emph{knows} relation.
In the trail, an edge can be only traversed once while nodes can be
traversed multiple times (as opposed to a path which allows repetitions
of both nodes and edges).
For each of these \emph{Persons}, retrieve all of their \emph{Messages}
that contain at least one \emph{Tag} belonging to a given
\emph{TagClass} (direct relation not transitive). For each
\emph{Message}, retrieve all of its \emph{Tags}.
Group the results by \emph{Persons} and \emph{Tags}, then count the
\emph{Messages} by a certain \emph{Person} having a certain \emph{Tag}.
(Note: it is not yet decided whether a \emph{Person} connected to the
start \emph{Person} on a trail with a length smaller than
\texttt{minPathDistance}, but also on a trail with the length in
\texttt{{[}minPathDistance,\ maxPathDistance{]}} should be included. The
current reference implementations allow such \emph{Persons}, but this
might be subject to change in the future.)
