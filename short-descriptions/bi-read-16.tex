\paragraph{Q16.}
Given a \emph{Person}, find all other \emph{Persons} that live in a
given \texttt{country} and are connected a to given \texttt{person} by a
transitive path with length in range
\texttt{{[}minPathDistance,\ maxPathDistance{]}} through the
\emph{knows} relation.
In the path, an edge can be only traversed once while nodes can be
traversed multiple times.
For each of these \emph{Persons}, retrieve all of their \emph{Messages}
(\emph{Posts} \& \emph{Comments}) that contain at least one \emph{Tag}
belonging to a given \emph{TagClass} (direct relation not transitive).
For each \emph{Message}, retrieve all of its \emph{Tags}.
Group the results by \emph{Persons} and \emph{Tags}, then count the
\emph{Messages} by a certain \emph{Person} having a certain \emph{Tag}.
