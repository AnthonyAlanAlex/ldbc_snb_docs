\textbf{Q6.}
Get Persons who have created a Message (Post or Comment) with a given
Tag.
Each Person has a score, computed as follows: 1. Count of Messages with the given Tag (\texttt{messageCount}), 2. Count of Likes (\texttt{likeCount}) and Comments (\texttt{replyCount}) in reply of their Messages with the given Tag (direct relation not transitive).
The \texttt{score} is calculated as a sum with the following weights: Messages (\texttt{messageCount}) are multiplied by 1, Comments to Messages (\texttt{replyCount}) are multiplied by 2, Likes (\texttt{likeCount}) are multiplied by 10.
