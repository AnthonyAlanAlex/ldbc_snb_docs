\paragraph{Q6.}
Get \emph{Persons} who have created a \emph{Message} with a given
\emph{Tag}.
Each \emph{Person} has a score, computed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Count of \emph{Messages} with the given \emph{Tag}
  (\texttt{messageCount}).
\item
  Count of \emph{Likes} (\texttt{likeCount}) and \emph{Comments}
  (\texttt{replyCount}) in reply of their \emph{Messages} with the given
  \emph{Tag} (direct relation not transitive).
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{score} is calculated as a sum with the following weights:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Messages} (\texttt{messageCount}) are multiplied by 1,
\item
  \emph{Comments} to \emph{Messages} (\texttt{replyCount}) are
  multiplied by 2,
\item
  \emph{Likes} (\texttt{likeCount}) are multiplied by 10.
\end{itemize}
