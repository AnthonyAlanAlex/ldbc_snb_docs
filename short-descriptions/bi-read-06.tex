\paragraph{\textbf{Q6}. Most active Posters of a given Topic.}
Get each \emph{Person} (\texttt{person}) who has created a
\emph{Message} (\texttt{message}) with a given \emph{Tag} (direct
relation, not transitive). For each \emph{Person}~node:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Count its \texttt{message}s (\texttt{messageCount}).
\item
  Count \emph{likes} (\texttt{likeCount}) to its \texttt{message}s.
\item
  Count \emph{Comments} (\texttt{replyCount}) in reply to it
  \texttt{message}s.
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{score} is calculated according to the following formula:
\texttt{1\ *\ messageCount\ +\ 2\ *\ replyCount\ +\ 10\ *\ likeCount}.
