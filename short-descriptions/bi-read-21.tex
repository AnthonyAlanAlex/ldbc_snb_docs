\paragraph{Q21.}
Find zombies within the given \texttt{country}, and return their zombie
scores.
A zombie is a \emph{Person} created before the given \texttt{endDate}
and that has created between \texttt{{[}0,\ 1)} \emph{Messages} per
month, on average, during the time range between profile creation date
and the given \texttt{endDate}. The number of months spans the time
range from creation date of the profile to the \texttt{endDate} and also
includes partial months.
For each \emph{Person}, calculate the following:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{zombieLikeCount}: the number of likes received from zombies
\item
  \texttt{totalLikeCount}: the total number of likes received on that
  \emph{Person}'s \emph{Messages}
\item
  \texttt{zombieScore}: \texttt{zombieLikeCount} /
  \texttt{totalLikeCount}
\end{itemize}
In all cases, only count likes received from profiles that were created
before the given \texttt{endDate}.
