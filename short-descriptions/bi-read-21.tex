\paragraph{Q21.}
Find zombies within the given country, and return their zombie scores.
A zombie is a Person created before the given \texttt{endDate} and that
has created between \texttt{{[}0,\ 1)} Messages per month, on average,
during the time range between profile creation date and the given
\texttt{endDate}. The number of months spans the time range from
creation date of the profile to the \texttt{endDate} and also includes
partial months.
For each person, calculate the following:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{zombieLikeCount}: the number of likes received from zombies
\item
  \texttt{totalLikeCount}: the total number of likes received on that
  Person's messages
\item
  \texttt{zombieScore}: \texttt{zombieLikeCount} /
  \texttt{totalLikeCount}
\end{itemize}
In all cases, only count likes received from profiles that were created
before the given \texttt{endDate}.
