\paragraph{\textbf{Q21}. Zombies in a country.}
Find zombies within the given \texttt{country}, and return their zombie
scores. A \texttt{zombie} is a \emph{Person} created before the given
\texttt{endDate}, which has created an average of \texttt{{[}0,\ 1)}
\emph{Messages} per month, during the time range between profile's
\texttt{creationDate} and the given \texttt{endDate}. The number of
months spans the time range from creation date of the profile to the
\texttt{endDate} with partial months on both end counting as one month
(e.g.~a \texttt{creationDate} of Jan 31 and an \texttt{endDate} of Mar 1
result in 3 months).
For each \texttt{zombie}, calculate the following:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{zombieLikeCount}: the number of \emph{likes} received from
  other zombies
\item
  \texttt{totalLikeCount}: the total number of \emph{likes} received
\item
  \texttt{zombieScore}: \texttt{zombieLikeCount} /
  \texttt{totalLikeCount}
\end{itemize}
For both \texttt{zombieLikeCount} and \texttt{totalLikeCount}, only
consider \emph{likes} received from profiles that were created before
the given \texttt{endDate}.
