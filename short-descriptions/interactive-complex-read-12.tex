\paragraph{\textbf{Q12}. Expert search.}
Given a start \emph{Person}, find the \emph{Comments} that this
\emph{Person}'s friends made in reply to \emph{Posts}, considering only
those \emph{Comments} that are direct (single-hop) replies to
\emph{Posts}, not the transitive (multi-hop) ones. Only consider
\emph{Posts} with a \emph{Tag} in a given \emph{TagClass} or in a
descendent of that \emph{TagClass}. Count the number of these reply
\emph{Comments}, and collect the \emph{Tags} that were attached to the
\emph{Posts} they replied to, but only collect \emph{Tags} with the
given \emph{TagClass} or with a descendant of that \emph{TagClass}.
Return \emph{Persons} with at least one reply, the reply count, and the
collection of \emph{Tags}.
