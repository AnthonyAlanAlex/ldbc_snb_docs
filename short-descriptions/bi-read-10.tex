\paragraph{\textbf{Q10}. Central Person for a Tag.}
Given a \emph{Tag}, find all \emph{Persons} that are either interested
in the \emph{Tag}, or have written a \emph{Message} (\emph{Post} or
\emph{Comment}) with a creation date after a given \texttt{date} and
that has a given \emph{Tag}. For each \emph{Person}, compute the
\texttt{score} as the sum of the following two aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  100, if the \emph{Person} has this \emph{Tag} as their interest, or 0
  otherwise
\item
  number of \emph{Messages} by this \emph{Person} with the given
  \emph{Tag}
\end{itemize}
Also, for each \emph{Person}, compute the sum of the score of the
\emph{Person}'s friends (\texttt{friendsScore}).
