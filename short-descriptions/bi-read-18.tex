\paragraph{Q18.}
For each \emph{Person}, count the number of \emph{Messages} they made
(\texttt{messageCount}). Only consider \emph{Messages} with the
following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{content} not empty (and consequently, \texttt{imageFile} empty
  for \emph{Posts}),
\item
  \texttt{length} below the \texttt{lengthThreshold} (exclusive,
  equality is not allowed),
\item
  \texttt{creationDate} after \texttt{date} (exclusive, equality is not
  allowed),
\item
  The *Message is written in any of the given \texttt{languages}.
\item
  The language of a \emph{Post} is defined by its \texttt{language}
  attribute.
\item
  The language of a \emph{Comment} is that of the \emph{Post} that
  initiates the thread where \emph{Comment} replies to.
\end{itemize}
For each \texttt{messageCount} value, count the number of \emph{Persons}
with exactly \texttt{messageCount} \emph{Messages} (with the required
attributes).
