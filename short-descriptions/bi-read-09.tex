\paragraph{Q9.}
Given two \emph{TagClasses} (\texttt{tagClass1} and \texttt{tagClass2}),
find \emph{Forums} that contain
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  at least one \emph{Post} (\texttt{post1}) with a \emph{Tag} with a
  (direct) type of \texttt{tagClass1} and
\item
  at least one \emph{Post} (\texttt{post2}) with a \emph{Tag} with a
  (direct) type of \texttt{tagClass2}.
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{post1} and \texttt{post2} nodes may be the same \emph{Post}.
Consider the \emph{Forums} with a number of members greater than a given
\texttt{threshold}. For every such \emph{Forum}, count the number of
\texttt{post1} nodes (\texttt{count1}) and the number of \texttt{post2}
nodes (\texttt{count2}).
