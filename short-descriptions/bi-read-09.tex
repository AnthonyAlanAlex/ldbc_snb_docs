\paragraph{Q9.}
Given two \emph{TagClasses} (\texttt{tagClass1} and \texttt{tagClass2}),
find \emph{Forums} that contain at least one \emph{Post} with a
\emph{Tag} from \texttt{tagClass1} and at least one \emph{Post} with a
\emph{Tag} from \texttt{tagClass2} (direct children not transitive) --
this may be the same \emph{Post}.
Consider the \emph{Forums} with a number of members greater than a given
\texttt{threshold}. For every such \emph{Forum}, count the number of
\emph{Posts} that have a \emph{Tag} from \emph{TagClass1}
(\texttt{count1}), and the number of \emph{Posts} that have a \emph{Tag}
from \emph{TagClass2} (\texttt{count2}).
