\abstract{
LDBC's Social Network Benchmark (\ldbcsnb) is an effort intended to test
various functionalities of systems used for graph-like data management. For this,
\ldbcsnb uses the recognizable scenario of operating a social network, characterized by
its graph-shaped data.

\ldbcsnb consists of three sub-benchmarks, or workloads, that focus on different
functionalities. In this document, we present a preliminary version of the Interactive
Workload. The other workloads, still in development, are the Business
Intelligence Workloads (with analytical queries), and the Graph Analytics
Workload (with graph algorithms).\todo{Update this section}

This document contains a detailed explanation of the data used in the
whole \ldbcsnb benchmark, a detailed description for all the Interactive Workload,
and instructions on how to generate the data and run the benchmark
with the provided software.
