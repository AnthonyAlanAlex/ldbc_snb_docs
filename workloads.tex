\section{Query Description Format}
\label{sub:queries_structure}
Queries are described in natural language using a well-defined structure that consists of three sections:
\textit{description}, a concise textual description of the query;
\textit{parameters}, a list of input parameters and their types;
and \textit{results}, a list of expected results and their types.
The syntax used in \textit{parameters} and \textit{results} sections is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Entity}: entity type in the dataset.\\
        One word, possibly constructed by appending multiple words together, starting with uppercase character and following the camel case notation,
        \eg \texttt{TagClass} represents an entity of type ``TagClass''.
    \item \textbf{Relationship}: relationship type in the dataset.\\
        One word, possibly constructed by appending multiple words together, starting with lowercase character and following the camel case notation,
        and surrounded by arrow to communicate direction,
        \eg \mbox{\texttt{-worksAt->}} represents a directed relationship of type ``worksAt''.
    \item \textbf{Attribute}: attribute of an entity or relationship in the dataset.\\
        One word, possibly constructed by appending multiple words together, starting with lowercase character and following the camel case notation,
        and prefixed by a ``.'' to dereference the entity/relationship,
        \eg \texttt{Person.firstName} refers to ``firstName'' attribute on the ``Person'' entity,
        and \mbox{\texttt{-studyAt->.classYear}} refers to ``classYear'' attribute on the ``studyAt'' relationship.
    \item \textbf{Unordered Set}: an unordered collection of distinct elements.\\
        Surrounded by \{ and \} braces, with the element type between them,
        \eg \texttt{\{String\}} refers to a set of strings.
    \item \textbf{Ordered List}: an ordered collection where duplicate elements are allowed.\\
        Surrounded by [ and ] braces, with the element type between them,
        \eg \texttt{[String]} refers to a list of strings.
    \item \textbf{Ordered Tuple}: a fixed length, fixed order list of elements, where elements at each position of the tuple have predefined, possibly different, types. \\
        Surrounded by < and > braces, with the element types between them in a specific order
        \eg \texttt{<String, Boolean>} refers to a 2-tuple containing a string value in the first element and a boolean value in the second,
        and \texttt{[<String, Boolean>]} is an ordered list of those 2-tuples.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Categorization of results.} Results are categorized according to their source of origin:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Raw} (\texttt{R}), if the result is returned with an unmodified value and type.
	\item \textbf{Calculated} (\texttt{C}), if the result is calculated from other values and conditions.
	\item \textbf{Aggregated} (\texttt{A}), if the result is an aggregated value, \eg a count or a sum of another value. If a result is both calculated and aggregated (\eg $\mathsf{count(x) + count(y)}$ or $\mathsf{avg(x + y)}$), it is considered an aggregated result.
\end{itemize}

\section{Query Definitions}

\subsection{Notation}

\paragraph{Intervals.} Closed interval boundaries are denoted with \texttt{[} and \texttt{]}, while open interval boundaries are denoted with \texttt{(} and \texttt{)}. For example, \texttt{[0, 1)} denoted an interval between 0 and 1, closed on the left and open on the right.

\subsection{Morphisms}

\todo{Discuss \emph{homomorphism} \vs \emph{isomorphism}}

\subsection{Graph Patterns}

To illustrate queries, we use graph patterns such as \autoref{fig:example-graph-pattern} with the following notation:

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=\patternscale,margin=0cm .2cm]{patterns/bi-read-08}
		\caption{Example graph pattern.}
		\label{fig:example-graph-pattern}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Vertices are marked as \textsf{entityName:EntityType} (camel case notation, starting with a lowercase character for the former and an uppercase character for the latter). The \textsf{entityName} is assigned if the vertex or its attributes are used later for aggregation or as part of the query result. If they are not used later, the \textsf{entityName}  can be omitted.
	\item Positive conditions for edges are denoted with solid lines.
	\item Negative conditions for edges, \ie edges that are not allowed in the graph, are denoted with \textcolor{red}{\dashuline{dashed red}} lines.
	\item Edges without direction imply that there must be an edge in \emph{at least one of the directions}.
	\item Filtering conditions are typeset in \textit{italic}, \eg $\mathit{id} = \mathit{\textdollar tag}$.
	\item Attributes that should be returned are denoted in sans-serif font, \eg $\mathsf{name}$.
	\item Variable length paths, \ie edges that can be traversed multiple times are denotes with $*\mathsf{min}...\mathsf{max}$, \eg $\mathsf{replyOf}*$ or $\mathsf{knows*1 \ldots 2}$. By default, the value of $\mathsf{min}$ is 1, and the value of $\mathsf{max}$ is unlimited.
	\item Aggregations are shown in dashed boxes with the type of aggregation ($\mathsf{count}$, $\mathsf{sum}$, $\mathsf{avg}$, etc.) in the upper right corner.
\end{itemize}

\newcommand{\tuple}[1]{\langle #1 \rangle}

\paragraph{Keywords.} The notation uses a small set of keywords:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textsf{UNWIND} unnests a list, \ie produces a set of one-tuples. For example, UNWIND $ [1, 2, 3] $ results in $ \{ \tuple{1}, \tuple{2}, \tuple{3} \} $)
	\item Aggregation operations: \lstinline{count}, \lstinline{avg}. % \lstinline{sum} - sum is not used in the figures as we always sum some derived value
	\item Functions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \lstinline{floor(x)} (returns $\lfloor x \rfloor$),
		\item \lstinline{year(date)} (extracts the year from a given date),
		\item \lstinline{month(date)} (extracts the month from a given date).
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Resolving ambiguity.} Note that if the textual description and the graph pattern are different for a particular query (either due to an error or the lack of sophistication in the graphical syntax), \emph{the textual description takes precedence}.
