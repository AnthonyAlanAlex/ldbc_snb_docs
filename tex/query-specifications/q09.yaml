  Given two TagClasses (`tagClass1` & `tagClass2`), find Forums that contain at least one Post with a Tag from
  `tagClass1` and at least one Post with a Tag from `tagClass2` (direct children not transitive) -- this may be the same Post.

  Consider the Forums with a number of members greater than a given threshold.
  For every such forum, count the number of Posts that have a Tag from TagClass1 (count1), and the number of posts
  that have a tag from TagClass2.
