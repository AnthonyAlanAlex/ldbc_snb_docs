LDBC's Social Network Benchmark (LDBC-SNB) is an effort intended to test
various functionalities of systems used for graph-like data management. For this,
LDBC-SNB uses the recognizable scenario of operating a social network, characterized by
its graph-shaped data.

LDBC-SNB consists of three sub-benchmarks, or workloads, that focus on different
functionalities. In this document, we present a preliminary version of the Interactive
Workload. The other workloads, still in development, are the Business
Intelligence Workloads (with analytical queries), and the Graph Analytics
Workload (with graph algorithms).

This document contains a detailed explanation of the data used in the
whole LDBC-SNB benchmark, a detailed description for all the Interactive Workload,
and instructions on how to generate the data and run the benchmark
with the provided software.
