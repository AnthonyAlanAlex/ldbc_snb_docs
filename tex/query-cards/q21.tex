	description & Find zombies within the given country, and return their zombie scores.

A zombie is a Person created before the given \texttt{endDate} and that
has created between \texttt{{[}0,\ 1)} Messages per month, on average,
during the time range between profile creation date and the given
\texttt{endDate}.

The number of months spans the time range from creation date of the
profile to the \texttt{endDate} and also includes partial months.
