description: |
  Find those *Persons* of a given *Country* that replied to any *Message*, such that the reply does not have any *Tag* in common with the *Message* (only direct replies are considered, transitive ones are not). Consider only those replies that do no contain any word from a given `blacklist`. For each *Person* and valid reply, retrieve the *Tags* associated with the reply, and retrieve the number of *likes* on the reply.
  
  The detailed conditions for checking blacklisted words are currently as follows. Words do _not_ have to stand separately, i.e. if the word "Green" is blacklisted, "South-Greenland" cannot be included in the results. Also, comparison should be done in a case-sensitive way. These conditions are preliminary and might be changed in later versions of the benchmark.
