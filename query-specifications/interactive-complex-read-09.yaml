  This query looks for paths of length two or three, starting from a given Person, moving to its friends and friends of
  friends, and ending at their created Messages. This is one of the most complex queries, as the list of choke-points
  indicates. This query is expected to touch variable amounts of data with entities of different characteristics, and
  therefore, properly estimating cardinalities and selecting the proper operators will be crucial.
