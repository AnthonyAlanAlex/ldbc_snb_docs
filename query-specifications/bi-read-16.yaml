  Given a Person, find all other Persons that live in a given country and are connected to given person by a transitive
  path with length in range `[min, max]` through the knows relation.

  [DISCUSS\: edge isomorphism semantics]

  [Proposal for this (szarnyasg)\:] In the path, an edge might be only traveled once. (Consequently, it is not possible
  to travel an edge multiple times so that the path length reaches the minimum length.)

  For each of these Persons, retrieve all of their Messages (Posts & Comments) that contain at least one Tag belonging
  to a given TagClass (direct relation not transitive). For each Message, retrieve all of its Tags.

  Group the results by Persons and Tags, then count the Messages by a certain Person having a certain Tag.
