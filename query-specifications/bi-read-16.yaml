  Given a Person, find all other Persons that live in a given country and are connected to given person by a transitive
  path with length in range `[min, max]` through the knows relation.

  [DISCUSS\: edge isomorphism semantics]

  For each of these Persons, retrieve all of their Messages (Posts & Comments) that contain at least one Tag belonging
  to a given TagClass (direct relation not transitive).

  For each Message, also retrieve its Tags.
