title: Zombies in a country
description: |
  Find zombies within the given country, and return their zombie scores.

  A zombie is a Person created before the given `endDate` and that has created between `[0, 1)` Messages per month,
  on average, during the time range between profile creation date and the given `endDate`.
  The number of months spans the time range from creation date of the profile to the `endDate` and also includes
  partial months.

  For each person, calculate the following\:

  * `zombieLikeCount`: the number of likes received from zombies
  * `totalLikeCount`: the total number of likes received on that Person's messages
  * `zombieScore`: `zombieLikeCount` / `totalLikeCount`

  In all cases, only count likes received from profiles that were created before the given `endDate`.
