title: Stranger's interaction
description: |
  For all the *Persons* born after a certain `date`, find all the strangers they interacted with, where strangers are *Persons* that do not *know* each other. There is no restriction on the date that strangers were born.

  Consider only strangers that are

  * members of *Forums* tagged with a *Tag* with a (direct) type of `tagClass1` and
  * members of *Forums* tagged with a *Tag* with a (direct) type of `tagClass2`.

  The tags may be attached to the same *Forum* or they may be attached to different *Forums*.

  Interaction is defined as follows\: if *Person* _A_ replies to a *Message* by another *Person* _B_, there is an "interacted with" relationship from _A_ to _B_. Note that the "interacted with" relationship is directed.

  For each *Person*, count the number of strangers they interacted with (`strangerCount`) and total number of times they interacted with them (`interactionCount`).
