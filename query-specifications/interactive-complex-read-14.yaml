title: Weighted/unweighted paths
description: |
  Given two Persons, find all (unweighted) shortest paths between
  these two Persons, in the subgraph induced by the Knows
  relationship. Then, for each path calculate a weight.  The nodes in
  the path are Persons, and the weight of a path is the sum of
  weights between every pair of consecutive Person nodes in the path.
  The weight for a pair of Persons is calculated such that every
  reply (by one of the Persons) to a Post (by the other Person)
  contributes 1.0, and every reply (by ones of the Persons) to a
  Comment (by the other Person) contributes 0.5. Return all the
  paths with shortest length, and their weights. Do not return any rows
  if there is now path between the two Persons.
