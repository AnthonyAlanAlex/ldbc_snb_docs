  Get each *Person* (`person`) who has created a *Message* (`message`) with a given *Tag* (direct relation, not transitive). For each *Person*\ node:

  * Count its `message`s (`messageCount`).
  * Count *likes* (`likeCount`) to its `message`s.
  * Count *Comments* (`replyCount`) in reply to it `message`s.
