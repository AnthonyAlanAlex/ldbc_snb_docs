  Given two *TagClasses* (`tagClass1` and `tagClass2`), find *Forums* that contain

  * at least one *Post* (`post1`) with a *Tag* with a (direct) type of `tagClass1` and
  * at least one *Post* (`post2`) with a *Tag* with a (direct) type of `tagClass2`.

  The `post1` and `post2` nodes may be the same *Post*.

  Consider the *Forums* with a number of members greater than a given `threshold`.
  For every such *Forum*, count the number of `post1` nodes (`count1`) and the number of `post2` nodes (`count2`).

  - name: tagClass1
