  Given two *TagClasses* (`tagClass1` and `tagClass2`), find *Forums* that contain at least one *Post* with a *Tag* from `tagClass1` and at least one *Post* with a *Tag* from `tagClass2` (direct children not transitive) -- this may be the same *Post*.

  Consider the *Forums* with a number of members greater than a given `threshold`.
  For every such *Forum*, count the number of *Posts* that have a *Tag* from *TagClass1* (`count1`), and the number of *Posts* that have a *Tag* from *TagClass2* (`count2`).
parameters:
  - name: tagClass1
    type: 32-bit Integer
  - name: tagClass2
