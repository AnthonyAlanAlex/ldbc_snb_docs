  Given a start *Person*, find the *Comments* that this *Person*'s friends made in reply to *Posts*, considering only those *Comments* that are direct (single-hop) replies to *Posts*, not the transitive (multi-hop) ones. Only consider *Posts* with a *Tag* in a given *TagClass* or in a descendent of that *TagClass*. Count the number of these reply *Comments*, and collect the *Tags* that were attached to the *Posts* they replied to, but only collect *Tags* with the given *TagClass* or with a descendant of that *TagClass*. Return *Persons* with at least one reply, the reply count, and the collection of *Tags*.

  This query looks for paths of length three, starting at a *Person*, moving to its friends, the to their *Comments* and ending at the *Post* the *Comments* are replying. The chain from original post to the reply is transitive. The traversal may be initiated at either end, the system may note that this is a tree, hence leaf to root is always best. Additionally, a hash table can be built from either end, e.g. from the friends of self, from the tags in the category, from the or other.
