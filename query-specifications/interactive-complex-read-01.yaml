  This query is a representative of a simple navigational query. It looks for paths of length 1..3 through
  the knows relation, starting from a given Person and ending at a Person with a given first name. It is interesting for several
  aspects. (1) It requires for a complex aggregation for returning the c ncatenation of universities, companies,
  languages and email information of the person. (2) It tests the ability of the optimizer to move the evaluation of
  sub-queries functionally dependant on the Person, after the evaluation of the top-k. (3) Its performance is
  highly sensitive to properly estimating the cardinalities in each transitive path, and paying attention not to explore
  already visited Persons.
